The Phase Estimation Algorithm
==============================

The phase estimation algorithm is a quantum subroutine useful for finding the
eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenvector \\(u\\) of some unitary operator.
It is the starting point for many other algorithms and relies on the inverse
quantum Fourier transform.  More details can be found in references [1]_.
