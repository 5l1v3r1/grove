The Quantum Fourier Transform
=============================

The quantum Fourier transform is the quantum implementation of the
discrete Fourier transform over the amplitudes of a wavefunction.  Detailed
explanations can be found in references [1]_ and [2]_.  The QFT forms the basis
of many quantum algorithms such as Shor's factoring algorithm, discrete
logarithm, and others to be found in the quantum algorithms zoo [3]_.
