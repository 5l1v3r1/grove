    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting, ensure that you have an installation of Python 2.7.(>= 10). You will need the most up to date version of ``pyQuil``, ``numpy``, and ``scipy``.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyQuil.git\n",

    "```\n",
    "export QVM_API_KEY=\"hex-dec-key\"\n",
