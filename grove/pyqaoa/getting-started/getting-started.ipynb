    "``pyqaoa`` contains the main QAOA algorithm object and problem specific instances. The ``QAOA`` abstract uses the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm in pyQuil to solve for the optimal angles rotation angles for an approximation to the ground state of the cost function.  State preparation is initialized by calling ``get_parameterized_program()`` that returns a functions that produces the quil program when given a set of parameters.  This functionality exploits ``ParametricProgram`` from pyQuil."

    "### Installation\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyQuil.git\n",
